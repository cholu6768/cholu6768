### Hi there i'm Fernando ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile! 

Currently working as a junior data analyst in the automotive replacement parts and accessories industry. 

I volunteered at TechLabs as a data analyst, supporting the marketing team with the development of Social Media KPI Dashboards to help the marketing team in what they should focus on.

I developed my interest in data analysis back in the summer of 2019. I was obtaining my Six Sigma Green Belt and saw the importance of data in problem-solving. 6 months after that, I started learning Python and tried out some exercises from a book I was reading (Mining Social Media). That's when I became fascinated by the powerful potential that lies in data. Since then I've been continuously learning. I enhanced my knowledge and critical thinking skills through courses and boot camps in Python, data analysis and visualization, SQL and Git. I've also participated in a data analysis contest and learned how to use Tableau. 

Additionally, I also wrote my bachelor's thesis about machine learning: "Detecting fake news in diverse news topics using Machine Learning (Traditional machine learning models and ensemble models)".
